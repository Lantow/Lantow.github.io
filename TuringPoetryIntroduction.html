	<h2>MILTON OR MASHINE?</h2>
	<h3>EXPERIMENT INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
	<section>
	First of all: THANK YOU FOR THE HELP AND PARTICIPATION! <br><br>
	In this experiment you are asked to assess both generated and real poetry. <br>
	The real poetry is random excerpts from John Milton's 1667 "Paradise Lost" <br>
	and the generated poetry is from a Generative Adversarial Neural Network <br>
	trained on the same text with different preprocessing methods. <br>
	<br>
	You will not be told if the author of the verse is machine or human, as this is part of your task to asses and guess. <br>
	<br>
	Besides guessing if the poetry is from a machine or from Milton,<br>
	you are asked to judge the poetry on two parameters: <b>Grammaticality</b>, and <b>Poeticness</b>.<br>
	The parameters are assessed on a 7 step scale going from least to most with 3 being the middle.<br>
	<br>
	The <b>*Gramaticallity</b> is to be understood as a measurement of weather the poetry adhere to your intuitions about grammar <br>
	- is there anything in the poetry that sounds like its not grammatically correct (ie. is there a verb where a noun should be etc.)? <br>
	If nothing - or close to nothing - is grammatically readable give a low score, and vice versa.<br>
	<br>
	The <b>*Poeticness</b> is to be understood as the semantics or the content of the poem. Does it make sense<br>
	 - does each line come together to form a whole - is there a hidden or direkt meaning in the verse.<br>
	 If the words are made up or if nothing - or close to nothing - makes any sense, or gives any meaning, give a low score, and vice versa.<br>
	 <br>
	 *You can see these definitions again by hovering over the text in the experiment.
	 <br>
	OBS! After each guess you will be presented with the correct answer in the bottom of the screen.	 <br>
	but note that this is not a competition! So no cheating and looking up if the poetry was by Milton or not <br>
	- Only honest answers help science<br>
